The finalised CIFs with the structure factor tables will be uploaded with the manuscript when it is out at a peer-reviewed journal, and will be deposited to CCDC.
To avoid confusions, we plan to remove this GitHub repository when we finalise the publication and CIFs. Please kindly cite the preprint article instead of this repostory when you refer to this study in your works.

Any questions and requests should be addressed to the corresponding author, Hiroki Kobayashi hiroki@eqchem.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp
