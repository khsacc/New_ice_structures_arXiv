This is the crystallographic information files for ices XXI, XXII, and XXIII reported by Kobayashi et al. on arXiv. 
The finalised CIFs with the structure factor tables will be uploaded with the manuscript when it is out at a peer-reviewed journal, and will be deposited to CCDC.
To avoid confusions, we plan to remove this GitHub repository when we finalise the publication and CIFs. Please cite the preprint article Kobayashi et al., arXiv, DOI: 	arXiv:2507.14415 [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14415](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14415) instead of this repostory when you kindly refer to this study in your works.
